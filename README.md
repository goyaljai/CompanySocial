What this App Does?
So basically our Application aims to bridge the gap between small vendors/businessmen and
customers. At the initial stage it is very challenging for a small scale businessmen to attract/acquire a
good customer base towards his product. It’s difficult for majority of people to bear the expense of
advertising their product.
To solve this problem out, our System will come into play. There will be two counterparts of the app,
i.e. admin add and the user app. Admin app will be given to the person who wants to advertise his/her
business, in this app he can upload all the necessary details, pictures , etc and it’s counterpart will be
available on the google playstore for customers to download, all the details, pictures, etc that were
uploaded on admin app will be displayed on user app in the best way possible by using best algorithms
to make it as attractive as possible and help the small scale businessmen.
